# AI-Powered Construction Safety Mechanism 

This Project involves in building the Object detectio model that detect wether the Employees at the construction site having SAfety equipment such as:

* Helmet
* Safety vest
* Mask

#### Additionally this model is capable of detecting 

 * Machinery
 * Persons
 * SAfetycone
